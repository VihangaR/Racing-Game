# Racing-Game
Racing game made in Java (Processing) utilizing functions and graphics
This was the final project I created in grade 11. Originally in our school the grade 11 project would be a game created using Turing but I wanted an even greater challenge and asked my teacher if I could create this in Java. We learn Java in grade 12 so he said sure and told me about Processing which is what I used to code this game. I learned the syntax and functions of Java in a couple of weeks and created this game which is essentilly a 2D side scrolling racing game with power ups/downs, and a score function!
